Changes to the eeg visualizer:
- dont use a notebook. Make the buttons pack and unpack the plots.
- some of the create tabs could be generalized

flow for the machine learning:
- First, generate data points with labels
- Then, train the model on the data points
- Then, save the model
- Then, load the model
- Then, use the model to make predictions on the live data points

notes:
- it will be much easier to train and evaluate the model on static data

Flow for color recording:
Gray for 60 seconds
Blue for 10 seconds
Gray for 60 seconds
Red for 10 seconds
Gray for 60 seconds
Green for 10 seconds

need to make a screen that shows colors and the prediction live

save the connection so that we dont have to connect twice DONE

Run the eeg data collection to let it level out before collecting data DONE

clear the deques before collecting data. DONE

need to add the saving files functionality

thread the connection to the eeg DONE

Make a reset or continue button for the heg visualizer

make a save button for the heg visualizer

use a deque for the heg visualizer DONE

save shit that leaves the deque so that it can be saved to a csv
