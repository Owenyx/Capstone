Todo for the visualizer:
- need to implement continue button for heg visualizer
- need to add a reset button to the heg visualizer
- need to ad saving and loading data for plotting

flow for the machine learning:
- First, generate data points with labels
- Then, train the model on the data points
- Then, save the model
- Then, load the model
- Then, use the model to make predictions on the live data points

Todo for the machine learning:
- need to make a screen that shows colors and the prediction live
- need to research what data we have to work with
- use logistic regression
- it seems that color prediction is only predictable within the same sitting
- percent data is better than raw data
- use robust scaler
