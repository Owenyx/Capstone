Make a function for making a new window that can be used with a button.
make a function for creating plots
make a function for updating plots

Changes to the eeg visualizer:
- dont use a notebook. Make the buttons pack and unpack the plots.
- some of the create tabs could be generalized
- just forget the fucking c program, let it run and start/stop the reading from the file rather than the c program.

flow for the machine learning:
- First, generate data points with labels
- Then, train the model on the data points
- Then, save the model
- Then, load the model
- Then, use the model to make predictions on the live data points

notes:
- it will be much easier to train and evaluate the model on static data

Flow for color recording:
Gray for 60 seconds
Blue for 10 seconds
Gray for 60 seconds
Red for 10 seconds
Gray for 60 seconds
Green for 10 seconds

need to make a screen that shows colors and the prediction live
save the connection so that we dont have to connect twice
