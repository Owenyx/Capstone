Todo for the visualizer:
- need to re-implement the other tabs for eeg
- need to implement continue button for heg visualizer
- need to add a reset button to the heg visualizer
- save the connection so that we dont have to connect twice


flow for the machine learning:
- First, generate data points with labels
- Then, train the model on the data points
- Then, save the model
- Then, load the model
- Then, use the model to make predictions on the live data points

Todo for the machine learning:
- need to make a screen that shows colors and the prediction live
- need to research what data we have to work with
- need to find a consistent model
- it seems that color prediction is only predictable within the same sitting
- use the percent data
- use robust scaler
