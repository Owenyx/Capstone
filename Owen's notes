Tree structure of deques in the Controller class used for output:
Note, The way to read this example:
--------------------------------
- deques
    - signal
        - O1
        - O2
        - T3
        - T4
            - timestamps
            - values
--------------------------------
Is as follows:
deques contains a signal branch that contains branches O1, O2, T3, T4, and
each of these branches contains a timestamps branch and a values branch
i.e. Every branch in a given level contains one of each of the branches in the next level immediately following it

Tree structure:

Other notes:
Monopolar is better for understanding activity in specific brain regions
Bipolar can be better at reducing noise and giving overall brain state measurements

Waves is the brain waves
Spectrum is like every single reading and is a bunch of different frequencies

The wave readings for emotions seem to be different than the wave readings for spectrum

Some notes on the data for attention and relaxation:
    - Oddly, the percentage values for attention and relaxation do not add up to 100%
    - On the other hand, the raw values do add up to 100
    - For the percentage values, it seems that only either relaxation or attention can be non-zero most of the time,
      sometimes both are low non-zero values at the same time though

Frequency of each reading:
    - signal: 250 Hz
    - resist: 1 Hz
    - emotions_bipolar: 25 Hz
    - emotions_monopolar: 25 Hz
    - spectrum: 5 Hz
    - waves: 5 Hz
